Dorrestein in the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California San Diego. Dr. Wang is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California Riverside. Dr. Wang is keenly interested in how computational approaches in analyzing mass spectrometry data can gain insight into the chemical world around us. Dr. Wang’s work has created computational tools that enable global visualization of unknown chemistry that makes it possible to rapidly discover new molecules. Dr. Wang has scaled these approaches mine repository scale data across all public metabolomics and natural products data that include billions of unknown molecules. Dr. Wang has led the development of computational tools and infrastructure that resulted in the GNPS ecosystem – a web analysis and knowledge curation infrastructure that became the de facto standard tool for the natural products, metabolomics, and chemical ecology research communities. His computational tools are used by thousands of chemists and biologists from around the world each month. Dr. Wang co-founded Ometa Labs in 2017 that commercialized the computational tools he developed during his PhD and postdoctoral studies.

The candidate will develop and implement computational solutions to establish and manage a Knowledge Graph documenting the chemodiversity of living systems using both untargeted metabolomics data and semantic web technologies.\nProject Background In the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI), we leverage the outstanding living plant collections of Swiss botanical gardens as artificial yet accessible biodiversity hotspots. The long term objective of this Open Science initiative is to establish robust and scalable workflows designed to characterize and document the chemodiversity of the biosphere at a global scale (see Earth Metabolome Initiative). To achieve this, we exploit the unrivaled sensitivity and structural determination potential of mass spectrometry and the power of semantic web technologies to build a large-scale digital library capturing the wealth of chemo- and bio-diversity knowledge. This open resource will be designed to i) advance the field of life science, ii) benefit human society (e.g. drug discovery from Nature and sustainable agriculture solutions) and iii) support biodiversity conservation projects.\nJob Description The objective of the candidate will be to develop and implement computational solutions for the establishment of a domain-specific knowledge graph gathering a large amount of unstructured and semi-structured data. This knowledge graph will be designed to organize chemodiversity-related data obtained during untargeted mass-spectrometry based metabolomics experiments but also a wide range of heterogeneous information related to the profiled samples (e.g., experimental metadata, phylogeny, geolocalizations, ecological traits). Special attention will be given to efficiently map and identify objects using resources such as the Bioregistry. The resulting graph will then be interfaced with relevant data and knowledge bases (e.g. ChEMBL, Wikidata, Pubchem). The candidate will work in close collaboration with data scientists from the Swiss Bioinformatics Institute for ontology engineering and the establishment of natural language processing-based interfaces to facilitate access to the data by scientists worldwide. The candidate will craft innovative interfaces to visualize and query the established knowledge base. Finally, the interest of alternative solution to the classical publication system (e.g. Nanopublications) will be explored for the input/output of information to/from the graph and for the overall dissemination of knowledge acquired in the frame of the DBGI.\nYour Profile  You are highly motivated to contribute to a project focused on describing and conserving biodiversity. You hold a PhD in data / computer science with a strong track record of relevant experience. You have experience with data modeling, semantic technologies, and Linked (Open) Data handling. You are interested in data visualization. You are familiar with open software projects and Open Research Data. You are enthusiastic about learning and expanding your skill set in order to contribute towards the success of the project.  We Offer:  A stimulating, friendly and supportive research environment. Access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. Opportunities for professional development and training.  Starting Date: June-July 2023 for 1.5 years. This is a 100% postdoc position, fully funded by swissuniversities.\nHow to Apply? Please send the following information to pierre-marie.allard(at)unifr.ch\n A cover letter outlining your research experience and interests, and why you are interested in this position.

When applying this idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These are also the principles of Open Notebook Science\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. We share our early research outputs in several places.\nIdeas, notes and lab notebook To gather these we use the Dendron note managing system. The DBGI Dendron is reachable at https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/ Expect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to observe and participate at each step of the process. When we take notes these are meant for others but also for us, in the future. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. We are making it a methodological experiment !\nCode The code written in the frame of the DBGI is versioned and centralized under the following Github organization https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative. Feel free to raise an issue on the corresponding repositories if you have any question, comment or suggestion on the code. We see this github organization as a place for everybody to learn !
